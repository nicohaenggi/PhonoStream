            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>
                The following terms and conditions govern the use of the services provided on www.phostream.com (hereafter referred to as “phonostream”).
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your access to and use of phonostream is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access phonostream.</li>
                <li>The use of phonostream is governed by the law of Switzerland with the following modifications and explanations to be considered.</li>
                <li>Phonostream offers a technical service on a voluntary basis. Hence, phonostream does not take liability for the service working unimpeded or for permanent availability of the service.</li>
                <li>Phonostream must only be used for private purposes. Any commercial use of phonostream is strictly forbidden and will be pursued in a court of law.</li>
                <li>Phonostream is only to be used to access content which was posted onto the Soundcloud platform by an authorised third party. The user is obliged to check respective rights concerning the content.</li>
                <li>Accessing pornographic content or such content that infringes any right in any other way is strictly forbidden. In case a third party right is already violated by downloading the content, the user bears complete responsibility for this as he started the processing of the data in question.</li>
                <li>Accessing the systems or services of phonostream in any way other than the intended use is forbidden.</li>
                <li>It is the only purpose of phonostream to create a copy of downloadable online-content for the private use of the user ("fair use"). Any further use of the content transmitted by phonostream, particularly but not exclusively making the content publicly accessible or using it commercially, must be agreed upon with the holder of the rights of the respective downloaded content. The user bears full responsibility for all actions related to the data transmitted by phonostream. Phonostream does not grant any rights to the contents, as it only acts as a technical service provider.</li>
                <li>The user carries full responsibility for checking the legitimacy of his use of phonostream. Phonostream only provides the technical service. Hence, phonostream does not take liability towards the user or any third party for the permissibility of downloading content through phonostream.</li>
                <li>Our platform contains links to external websites of third parties, the contents of which cannot be influenced by us. Thus, we cannot take responsibility for this content. The responsibility lies with the respective provider or host of the websites in question. All linked websites were checked for violations of rights at the time of establishing the link. There was no suspicion of illegal content at that time. Continuous checking of the linked websites, however, is not reasonable without any concrete evidence of a rights violation. Should we be informed about any rights violation, we will immediately delete such links (DMCA).</li>
                <li>Should individual provisions of these present terms and conditions be or become ineffective, this shall not affect the effectiveness of the remaining provisions. The ineffective provision shall be replaced by a substitute provision regulating the intended purpose of the ineffective provision as precisely as possible.</li>
                <li>The legal venue shall, if admissible, be Zurich, Switzerland.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</li>
                <li>Every request made on phonostream is requested by a user himself. Therefore, we are only providing a service and never permanently store any files on our servers. Hence, we will only be able to block third-party links violating DMCA, as phonostream is not the owner (“Soundcloud Inc.”) of the requested files.</li>
